,,"The passage you provided discusses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique that improves language model generation by incorporating relevant information from a large corpus of documents. This method is particularly useful for clients who have vast proprietary documents, as it allows for the extraction of specific information that might otherwise be difficult to find.

OpenAI's GPT4-Turbo is mentioned as a model that can process large documents, but it faces an efficiency issue known as the ""Lost In The Middle"" phenomenon. This issue causes the model to forget content in the middle of its contextual window, which can hamper its efficiency.

The proposed alternative approach to this problem is Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG), which involves creating an index for each document paragraph and swiftly identifying pertinent paragraphs. This approach allows for the retrieval of specific information without relying on the model's contextual window, potentially addressing the ""Lost In The Middle"" phenomenon.

FAISS indexing is mentioned in the context of this test file, but it is not explicitly discussed in the passage you provided. It is possible that FAISS indexing is being used as part of the Retrieval-Augmented-Generation approach to efficiently identify and retrieve pertinent paragraphs from the corpus of documents.",2025-04-22 15:18:52.464674
